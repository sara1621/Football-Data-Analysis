# Football Data Analysis Repository

This repository contains various codes and tutorials focused on **football event data analysis**, using Python and popular data science libraries. Itâ€™s a great resource for those looking to dive deeper into handling and visualizing football data.

## Contents

### Data Manipulation Techniques
1. **Concatenation & Splitting**: Efficient methods for merging and breaking down large datasets.
2. **Grouping & Filtering**: Advanced techniques to group data and retrieve meaningful subsets, crucial for focusing on specific players, teams, or match events.

### Visualization of Event Data (Heatmap Styles)
Check out the latest tutorial, **"Different Heatmap Styles for Football Event Data"**, where I walk through:
- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: Visualizing player activity areas on the pitch with smooth density plots.
- **Hexbin Plot**: A grid-based heatmap providing detailed spatial insights.
- **Custom Colormaps**: Explore how to create visually appealing custom colormaps for better data storytelling.

For those interested in generating visually informative plots and mastering football data manipulation, this tutorial will help you start visualizing football events with different **pitch styles** and **heatmap techniques**.
